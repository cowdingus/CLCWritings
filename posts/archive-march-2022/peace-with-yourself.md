Peace,  
Indeed this self is far from the word peace.  
Live in a world full of hate.  
Life in the world is hard.  

Peace,  
For me peace is an easy word to say,  
But itâ€™s hard to do.  

But now I believe,  
Peace is the sun,  
The sun that gives love.  

Peace,  
Is a word full of truth,  
Is a word full of trust,  
Is a word full of justice.  

Peace,  
The beauty of peace.  
Make peace,  
Because peace is beautiful,  
Because peace is calm,  
Because peace is happines.
