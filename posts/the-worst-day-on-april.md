The day that I really avoid all year round has come. Remembering what happened last
year, I feel like I just want to skip this day. How not? Everyone has prepared pranks and
just so you know, I really hate being pranked. Maybe it was fun for them, but not for
me. Laughing at someone under his suffering? Really, I don't understand what's so good
about it.

What a bright day, I was about to go to my office like usual. A baker offered me a
strawberry bread for free! This will be my lucky day. While walking, I took a little bite
of the bread “Yum! It’s tasty.” I took a bigger bite, chewed it, and you know what?
BOOM! “Spicy! This strawberry bread is so spicy!” I run as fast as I can, looking for a
water faucet. “Gosh, I almost forgot today is 1st April.” My temper was tested this
morning, but I tried to stay calm and headed back to work. When I got to the office, my
colleague sent me an email, he said that I was assigned to a company to do a
presentation. I borrowed the office car, and rushed to the company. In front of the
company gate, I saw a security guard stop me. “Excuse me, Sir. You’re not allowed to
enter this building.” Huh? What does he mean? "I already have a meeting scheduled
here, why can't I come in?” I tried to explain. “Can’t you see? This company has been
bankrupt and sealed since last month." Seriously, now I'm being pranked by my own
colleague? This is outrageous. I won't trust anyone until this day is over.

I returned to the office with a very unsightly expression on my face. I saw my colleague
who gave me a prank earlier sleeping at his desk. Yes, I intend to take revenge. Just
look at it! I took out a red marker and drew on his face as if it were paper. His face
already looks like a clown, Haha! "Hey, wake up. The boss is calling you to his room." I
tried not to laugh so as not to be caught. Without much question, my colleague
immediately stood up and headed for my boss's room. From a distance I heard my boss
yelling, "What's with that face? You want to be a circus clown?" The reaction I was
expecting. I laughed so hard that my stomach hurt. Unknowingly, it turns out that I'm
also celebrating April Fools which is a day that I hate the most. Well, it turned out to be
not that bad.
