Two months ago, I took a scholarship test to enter a university
in Switzerland. Before taking the test I studied very hard and hard. I
really use my time just to study, even when on vacation I still make
time to study. Before taking this test, of course, I had already received
approval from my parents, although at first it was not allowed. At first
I was not allowed because of course as parents they were worried if I
studied abroad alone. However, since I was young, I really wanted to
study abroad and my parents really knew and understood my desire,
so in the end they allowed me.

After two months, the test results came out and I was very
happy and surprised that I was successfully accepted at the University.
I deliberately did not tell this to my family. For April fool's I want to
make a very shocking prank. The first I made a prank for my sister.
My sister is a very indifferent person and we fight almost every day. I
want to test how much he cares for me. When I'm in my room I
pretend to cry and with a messy room like someone is depressed, sorry
but this is so funny. My brother knew about it, and he came to my
room and asked what happened to me. My sister asked why I was
crying with the state of the room like this. I also told him that I was
expelled from the scholarship because I was accused of cheating
during the exam. My sister was very surprised and felt disapproved
because I was expelled for reasons that were not clear and true. Then,
my sister came up to me and tried to calm me down.

I told how I struggled to take this test, but I was expelled for
reasons that were not clear and true. I also told the story and cried
even more, unexpectedly my sister was crying too and she hugged me
and she tried to calm me down. Since I thought it was time, I started to
carry out my original plan. I took a paper, then I said if this is a
statement that I was expelled from the scholarship test. In fact, it was
actually a letter containing a statement that I was successfully
accepted by the scholarship. My brother opened the letter and read it
to the end. My sister was very surprised, because what I said earlier
was a lie. Then I said “Yeah April Fools” and I laughed. Of course my
sister was very upset because I lied. I said if you can't be mad because
it's April Fools, so take it easy. Yes even though he was annoyed, he
was also happy with the results I got. I also made a prank for parents,
hahah sorry mom dad. I made the same prank as my sister. After
knowing it was all just a prank they were also annoyed and almost
angry with me. But, you can't even be angry, because this is April
fool's and of course this is a very happy thing.
