Dear diary of my life  

Hold my hands tight and don't let it go.  
For I yet want to be with you more.  
In this living nightmare I see.  
Fears, pain, and misery  
Of innocent kids and people, waiting for their death to come by.  
As ten thousand iron fireflies sprinkled against the night sky.  

Dear diary of my life  

I shouldn't have left you alone.  
For I know I won't be back for a long time.  
I shouldn't have left you alone.  
For I believe this stupid bloody war has taken the sanity of mine.  
I shouldn't have left you alone.  
For I long to see your beautiful smile under the tree of pine.  

Dear diary of my life  

Here I stood upon the plight.  
Wondering about the dim blue sky in the darkness, as the rain sauntered below the moonlight.  
Wishing that as this war will be over and I won't be dead  
For I crave my love for you and miss to be by your side.  

Dear diary of my life  

A moment of silence went through into my mind.  
When a couple of iron fireflies perches on my chest.  
And my body fell into the arms of the motherland.  
I glimpse your smile in those days flashing out in my mind as my eyes lay to rest.  

Dear diary of my life  

I can hear the sound of silence howling from a place far away  
"I won't be back for a long time," I'm afraid that's a lie I've told as my senses faltered away.  
For this will be the last moments I have, here is my little pray.  

May the wind always be at your back.  
May the sun shine warm upon your face.  
May the rains fall soft upon your cheeks.  
And may God always protect and never let you and our kids see war ever again, for you are the last peace I have.
