The car horn doesn't even subside  
The street never sleeps itself  
It silently watched;  
Silence like those lonely corners.  

A flock of birds dancing across the sky with romance in between  
Winding swings the flap their wings sweetly  
In the dim eyes, there is a beautiful radiance that adorn the universe  
Shade the twilight sky that will turn into night  
Without direction and without meaning  
Hunting for a rare freedom  

Silence is getting closer  
A few words is getting quieter  
There is a peace that never go home  
Enthroned a question that has no answer  

She celebrates silence alone  
Bridled comfortably there with a thousand doubts  
And with fear as a friend  
In a contemplation room, she waits there  
With an incandescent flame that ignites peace  
Remember many things and even a promise that was never okay  
It will eternal there, shackled by time that never ages
