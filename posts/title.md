Once upon a time, there were a person called Roy with a nickname goes by The
Prankster. He always love pranking people and he make a youtube content out of it.
Today is last day of March and he is trying to create the best prank on First April. He
schedule a live stream called “The First Prank on April Fools days” He slept and
waiting for the First April.

After morning, he woke up, starting to bath, eat, grabbing camera, started live streaming
and going outside. After going outside he saw people becoming zombies. He thinks that
it’s a dream, so he slap himself but nothing happen except hurt. The Zombies hear the
slapping noise so, the zombies run to Roy and he is running until to an alley.

The alley is blocked and no way out. He closed his eyes and hope something good
going to happen. After that he hear a firework. After opening his eyes, the zombies
laugh, smile and said “April Fools! Pranksters!”. He started to laugh and the zombies
opening his mask and it’s actually his own Neighbours. Everyone laugh with happiness
and started a party. The live stream ended and that day stream was called “Not a
Zombie Apocalypse”.
