It is 12:00 o’clock midday, lunch. I’m sitting down with some friends and they tell me

Friend: “man aren’t you excited for tomorrow?”

Confused I say, Me: “no, why would I be?”

Friend: “it’s April 1 st tomorrow”

Me: “Oooh. Still, why would I be? Being pranked on is a hassle”

Friend: “I mean you could prank anyone an they wouldn’t get mad”

Me: “really?”

Friend: “…Sure…”

Hearing this, I did get excited. And I schemed for all the pranks tomorrow. but little did I
know I was the one getting pranked and I just hadn’t noticed yet. Throughout the day I get pranked.
Like, they gave me a ton of work, put salt in my tea, splashing water on me, turning the lights off in
the bath room. I was so confused

Me: “if its April fools tomorrow why are they pranking me now”

I was mad, like very mad. when I got home, I prepared the biggest prank I’ve ever done.

It is 12:00 o’clock midnight, April 1 st . I’m still awake and went to the office, “its prank time” I
thought to myself. I didn’t get caught and went to their seats and covered it with flour, egg and
butter, I put a note saying “April fools”. I called it “a cakey surprise”, very bad name I know. After
that I went home and slept like a baby.

It is 8:45 in the morning and I go to the office waiting for them to come. One of them come
in.

Friend: “WHO DID THIS”

Internally I was laughing

Me: “April fools”

My friend gets mad

Friend: “WHAT DO YOU MEAN!??!”

Me: “its April first”

My friend grins

Friend “No it isn’t”

Me: “what?”

I checked my calendar…. Its April 2 nd

Me: “What”

Then it hit me, it all makes sense now. Why they we’re pranking me yesterday.

His April fools prank was telling me that today is April fools, even though it was yesterday… I
have been majorly pranked, and possibly bamboozled. The boss got mad at me and told me to clean
it up. I went home feeling defeated. And cried myself to sleep. The end.
