Today is April 1 st today is celebrated as a day full of lies. As usual some of my
friends always prank me. I thought my friend was playing a prank on me, and sure
enough he was doing a prank. Actually I&#39;m ready to accept all the prank that some of
my friends do.

On the morning of April 1 st , i was getting ready to go to school, and trying to
forget that it was April Fools&#39; Day. When I arrived at school, I studied as usual. When I
came home from school I was invited to eat meatballs with my crush, and at that time I
was very happy, without thinking I immediately accepted the invitation. When we eat
meatballs, my crush confesses his feelings to me, even though he knows that I like him
and I also know that he actually likes my other friend.

At that moment I immediately realized that it was a day of lies called April
Fool&#39;s Day. I tried to tell him not to play with love, &quot;if you really like me, tell the truth.
If you really want to prank me on April Fools&#39; Day, it shouldn&#39;t have anything to do
with feelings.&quot; I said. And it turns out he was just joking, and pranked me. He has
addmitted it. I hope he doesn&#39;t do the same out there, I hope if he wants to prank, it has
nothing to do with feelings. Actually I was hurt that he was playing with my feelings,
but he finally apologized and promised not to do it again, and I tried to accept and
forgive the apology.
