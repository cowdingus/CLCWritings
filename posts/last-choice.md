Sorrow eyes being on her sight  
Full of suffers which has begun to subside  
Tears coming down into her cheeks  
"Have i reached the finish line?"  

The emptiness has taken over  
Hasty breaths vying to urge her  
Tiime has come, no more misery  
She's leaving, please say goodbye  

Along with the winds, she close her eyes  
Threw herself into the skies  
Hope the clouds will carry her up  
To utopia, she saw in her dreams  

No more wailing and wittering sounds  
No more distracting and disturbing thoughts  
Did you see? it was a peaceful end  
Mother said, at least for her last
